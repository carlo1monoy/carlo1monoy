## 🎯 My Goals & Aspirations

1. **Master Mobile + ML Integration**  
   I’m working toward bridging mobile development with machine learning — for example, embedding simple neural nets in Flutter apps.

2. **Contribute to Meaningful Open-Source Projects**  
   I aim to join open-source communities where I can give back, learn, and collaborate on real-world software.

3. **Build a Personal Portfolio**  
   I want to build and maintain a portfolio (web + mobile) that reflects my journey and growth — especially my data-centric and app-centric projects.

## 🔧 Tools & Workflow

Here’s a peek at how I work:

- Use **Git** & **GitHub** for version control — all code is committed frequently with meaningful messages.  
- Develop **Flutter mobile apps** using **VS Code**.  
- Experiment with **data models** in **Jupyter Notebooks**.  
- Use **Firebase** for backend / real-time data needs in my apps.  
- Perform code reviews, test writing, and continuous refactoring whenever possible.

---

## 📚 Learning & Growth

- I regularly take **online courses** to improve my ML and app development skills.  
- I read **technical blogs**, **research papers**, and follow dev communities to stay on top of new trends.  
- I participate in **hackathons** to challenge myself, learn under pressure, and build meaningful projects.

## ✅ What I Can Help With

If you’re building something that involves:

- Flutter mobile app development  
- Simple machine learning models (classification / regression)  
- Data cleaning, data analysis, or data pipelines  
- Cross-platform UI / UX challenges  

… I’d be very interested in working together, giving feedback, or contributing.
